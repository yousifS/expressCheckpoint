checkpoint
- express api server that managed SOMETHING (todos, users, recipes, events, cars, students,)
- Requiremnts;
we want an api endpoint (route) that can
- add an item to the db
- update a item in the db, given the id
- list a summary of all items in the db
- get details about a single item, given the id
- delete an item in the db, given the id

you must use more than one file, ie. organize your code, using router file and controller file
you must use the static functionality to serve up an html file that acts as the documentation for your api
your code/functions should have good code comments / documentation
your application must connect to a database (mysql)
you must use dotenv module to store sensitive information (db password, username, url)
